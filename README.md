# VEDSAHAYAK

Vedsahayak is an advanced medical tool that utilizes augmented reality to generate 3D views of body organs from MRI and CT scans. This innovative approach allows doctors to visualize complex anatomical structures with precision, facilitating accurate and clear analysis. The project integrates cutting-edge AI and ML models to classify a range of diseases based on the scan data, enhancing diagnostic capabilities. By combining detailed imaging with intelligent disease classification, Vedsahayak aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnoses, ultimately supporting better patient outcomes and treatment planning.

We now provide this facility for brain 3d model using MRI and CT Scan. Also it can classify whether a person is suffering from brain tumor or not.

We are soon integrating 3D model of other organs along with various associated disease classification.
